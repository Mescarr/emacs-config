;; Failed to download MELPA archive
;; This occasionally happens when using Emacs <= 26.2 with Gnutls >= 3.6. The recommended fix is to update to Emacs 26.3 or greater.
;; Alternatively you can disable TLS1.3 by adding the following setting early in your init file. For more information see Emacs bug#34341.
